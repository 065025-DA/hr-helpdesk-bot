"""
Core RAG query engine for the Enterprise Policy RAG project.

This module implements the "production RAG" techniques called out in
the project brief: metadata-filtered retrieval (so a query can be
scoped to one or more departments instead of searching everything) and
cross-encoder reranking on top of raw vector similarity (raw cosine
similarity from an embedding model is a decent first pass, but a
reranker that reads the actual query and chunk together is
substantially better at ranking true relevance).

Two entry points are exposed for use by other modules (e.g. the
LangGraph router in router_agent.py, or the FastAPI app in app.py):

    query(question, department_filter=None) -> QueryResult
    retrieve_only(question, department_filter=None, top_k=15) -> list[NodeWithScore]

query() does the full pipeline: filtered retrieval -> rerank -> LLM
synthesis -> a structured result with the answer text, the source
chunks used, and which department(s) they came from.

retrieve_only() exposes just the retrieval+rerank step without LLM
synthesis, which the router agent needs when it wants to gather
evidence from multiple departments before deciding how to combine them.
