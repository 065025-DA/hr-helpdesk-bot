# Enterprise Policy RAG - Edith

**A production-style, multi-department Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.**
Document ingestion → department-aware retrieval & reranking → LangGraph-driven
routing and cross-department synthesis → rigorous evaluation → full-stack deployment.

## What it does

Employees ask natural-language questions about company policy — leave
entitlements, vendor contract approval thresholds, data retention rules,
IT security policy, and more — spanning four departments (HR, Legal,
Finance, IT). The system:

- Automatically determines which department's documents are relevant,
  including questions that genuinely span **more than one** department
  (for example: *"what data-sharing rules and payment terms apply if we
  bring on a new analytics vendor?"* needs both Legal and Finance)
- Retrieves and reranks the most relevant document passages
- Synthesizes a single, coherent, cited answer — reconciling multiple
  departments' input when needed, and flagging when departments disagree
  or have nothing relevant to add
- **Honestly declines to answer** when a question is out of scope,
  rather than producing a hallucinated response

## Why this isn't a tutorial RAG demo

Most RAG tutorials stop at "embed documents, run a similarity search, ask
an LLM." This project implements several techniques used in production
retrieval systems, and — importantly — **measures** them.

| Technique | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Metadata-filtered retrieval (scope search to specific departments) | `rag/query_engine.py` |
| Cross-encoder reranking on top of vector similarity | `rag/query_engine.py` |
| LLM-driven automatic query routing (LangGraph agent) | `rag/router_agent.py` |
| Cross-department synthesis with per-source attribution | `rag/router_agent.py` |
| Grounded generation with explicit abstention | `rag/query_engine.py` |
| A real, hand-labeled evaluation harness | `rag/evaluate.py` |

### Evaluation results

Two-tier evaluation against 21 hand-labeled questions spanning all four
departments, deliberately isolating retrieval quality from routing
accuracy:

| Mode | Metric | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Filtered retrieval (department pre-specified) | Hit Rate@4 | **100.0%** (21/21) |
| Filtered retrieval (department pre-specified) | MRR | **1.000** |
| End-to-end (fully automatic routing) | Source Hit Rate | **95.2%** (20/21) |
| End-to-end (fully automatic routing) | Department Classification Accuracy | **95.2%** (20/21) |

The one end-to-end miss is interpretable, not noise: a question
containing the word "band" was routed to HR (compensation bands) instead
of Finance (travel-entitlement bands) — a genuine cross-department
terminology collision. Full breakdown in `rag/evaluate.py`.

Heading-aware chunker     ──►  tagged chunks (department, doc type,
        │                       doc code, effective date, section)

```

**Why local embeddings + a cloud LLM?** Ollama Cloud's free tier
currently has no hosted embedding models, so embeddings run locally via
a small, fast open-source model via the Hugging Face Inference API with
negligible cost, while answer generation uses Ollama Cloud's free tier —
a deliberate, documented tradeoff, not an oversight.

## Running it yourself

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Docker, Node.js 18+, free accounts on
[Ollama Cloud](https://ollama.com), [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).

```bash
# Clone and set up the environment
git clone https://github.com/065008gif/enterprise-rag-platform.git
cd enterprise-rag-platform
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your API keys and Qdrant Cloud connection
cat > .env << 'EOF'
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_ollama_key_here
QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_cloud_url_here
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key_here
EOF

# Run the ingestion pipeline
python digest/parse_documents.py
python digest/chunk_documents.py
python digest/embed_and_upsert.py

# Build the frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run the backend locally
uvicorn rag.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000**.

## Deployment

The application is containerized (FastAPI backend + built React frontend,
served together) and deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, with document
embeddings and vector search running on **Qdrant Cloud** and text
embeddings generated via the **Hugging Face Inference API** — fully
managed, no self-hosted infrastructure required. The service is live at
**[enterprise-rag-platform-829933777976.asia-south1.run.app](https://enterprise-rag-platform-829933777976.asia-south1.run.app/)**.

Cloud Run scales to zero when idle, so the first request after a period
of inactivity may take up to a minute while the container starts and
loads the reranking model; subsequent requests are fast.

Verified working from a mobile device on cellular data (not the same
network as any development machine), confirming genuine public
reachability.
